# Ansible passes a large number of SSH parameters along with the hostname as the
# second to last argument and the command as the last. We will pop the last two
# arguments off of the list and then pass all of the other SSH flags through
# without modification:

cmd="${@: -1: 1}"

# Unfortunately ansible has hardcoded ssh options, so we need to filter these out
# It's an ugly hack, but for now we'll only accept the options starting with '--'
